# drupal-8-theme-test
My first Drupal 8 theme using Boostrap. Built on the drupal-8.0.0-beta15 dev version of Drupal to test various things.

I've created contents on my Drupal installation using no additionnal modules as almost nothing was available at that time with the dev version of Drupal.
Here's a list of some things I create and/or simply integrate and design with Twig :

a Blog section
Categories for articles
A recent articles block
a multimedia content type : articles with slideshows (Bootstrap caroussel)
books
a custom front page
the possibility to change the header image of every post when editing an article

This certainly isn't perfect as it was jsut a sandbox for me to start with Drupal 8 theming, if you see things that could be improve please let ne know, I'll be happy to improve my code and knowledge of Drupal 8 or Twig.
